### How does this relate to course material?

While documenting this project, I found a lot of what I learned in class invaluable and very applicable. I'll relate the project to course material section by section.

The installation section explores what we learned in class about Package Management. We learned of how apt-get looks through lists of repositories for your desired application. I extended on this by showing the user how to add private repositories and their advantages. I also explored other package management solutions for different distributions.
