### Program Description

Radiotray is a simple GTK+ internet radio station manager that lives in the system tray. You feed it a se ***EXPAND***

***KEY FEATURES***

On windows, there is a similar program called "Radio? Sure!" that resides in the tasktray. It mirrors a lot of Radio Tray's functionality but differs in that the windows application actually gives you access to a user maintained database of Internet Radio stations.

On Linux, Radio Tray is fairly unique. Some people would compare it to KDE's [Amarok](http://amarok.kde.org/) or Novell's [Banshee](http://banshee.fm/), but these are more general music applications that are general and far more featured. They stray from Radio Tray's single purposeness. They aren't as well suited to managing and playing Internet Radio, despite being able to.

### How does this relate to course material?

While documenting this project, I found a lot of what I learned in class invaluable and very applicable. I'll relate the project to course material section by section.

The installation section explores what we learned in class about Package Management. We learned of how apt-get looks through lists of repositories for your desired application. I extended on this by showing the user how to add private repositories and their advantages. I also explored other package management solutions for different distributions.
