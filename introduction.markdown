###Description

Radio Tray is a simple internet radio player that lives in the system tray or Application Indicator. It saves a list of your favourite stations for easy access to wonderful music. Its aim is to be as simple as possible, staying out of the way and doing one thing really well.

###Similar Programs

On Windows, *Radio? Sure!* is a similar program that also resides in the tasktray. It mirrors a lot of Radio Tray's functionality but differs in that the Windows application actually gives you access to a user maintained database of Internet Radio stations.

On Linux, Radio Tray is fairly unique. Some people would compare it to KDE's [Amarok](http://amarok.kde.org/) or Novell's [Banshee](http://banshee.fm/), but these are more general media applications and are far more featured. They stray from Radio Tray's single purposeness. They aren't as well suited to managing and playing Internet Radio, despite being able to.

[Audacious](http://audacious-media-player.org/) shares Radio Tray's simplicity, but is geared to being an all around music player. It has the same support for Internet radio station, but doesn't do a very good job managing or bookmarking them. While Radio Tray is designed to stay hidden, Audacious is much more front and center, having the user interact with it more often to set playlists and move the window around.
