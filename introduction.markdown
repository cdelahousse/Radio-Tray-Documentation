#Documentation Project

**Project Name:** Radio Tray

**Project Site:** <http://radiotray.sourceforge.net/>

I decided to have the Methodology section follow the Documentation Section. The document's ordering seems more natural this way. 

This document uses the following conventions:

* "$> `command`" denotes a command line prompt and associated command
* Any `word` in a mono spaced font is a technical keyword
* References to source material are links within the document's body
